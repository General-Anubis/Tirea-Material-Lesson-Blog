## Word Order

The word order of English is very specific. In the simplest of sentences, it is always the same: The subject comes first, then the verb. If there is an object, then it comes after the verb:

> She runs. (_subject verb._)

> He cooks food. (_Subject verb object_.)

Word order in the Na'vi language is very flexible unlike the rigid word order in English.

- **Poe tul.**
- _She runs._

- **Tul poe.**
- _She runs._

## Most Basic Sentences

The simplest and easiest sentences in the Na'vi language are the 2 word sentences, just like that one in the example above.

- **Tìkenong fìtseng.**
- _Example here._

## Noun Cases and Verbs

In English, the word order of a sentence establishes the roles of the people or things involved. For example, compare these:

- _Jake hunts an animal._
- _An animal hunts Jake._

As you see, the roles are switched by changing which one comes before the verb and which one comes after the verb.

In Na'vi, however, since the word order in a sentence like this is entirely flexible, word order itself tells us nothing about the roles. Instead, the Na'vi use what are called Cases, which are small changes to the _words_ to keep track of the roles. 

- **Tìkenong fìtseng.**
- _Example here._
